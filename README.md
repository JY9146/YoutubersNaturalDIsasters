A faithful recreation of the Volcanoes and Sinkholes in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2SOKyNJ1jQ. If you have anything to add, make a pull request or a fork or whatever.

Hopefully planing on more features like chemical warfare (splash potion of gas), earthquakes, throw TNT, throw meteor, the End-It-All Meteor, etc from this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h61SlPZfWfw
NOT AT ALL FINISHED YET! Please don't clone it, the mod isn't finished yet! We will update the Readme when it is! If you want to help us make it (as we don't have much coding experience) DM JY9146 on Discord!

The project isn't dead, it is being worked on through MCreator and we have a lot if ideas for this mod, so it might take some time. We will try to keep you guys updated on how it's going.
So far we have been working on the meteors and the Gas, we will soon make a Weather Storms and Tornadoes compatibility. Then we will code sinkholes and tornadoes!
